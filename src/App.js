                        As a frontend developer, I specialize in creating modern
                        websites and apps that assist businesses in gaining an
                        advantage over their competitors.

                      <p>
                        My expertise includes working with technologies such as
                        HTML, CSS, Javascript, SASS, Styled Components, and
                        React JS.

                        Additionally, I am currently in the process of learning
                        the basics of UX/UI design to enhance my coding
                        abilities.
